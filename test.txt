The United Kingdom is a small island and with a population of around 55 million is very overpopulated. It has an inadequate and expensive public transport system which as a result is forcing more and more cars onto the road. Britain now has the most cars per mile of road anywhere in the world and modern traffic policies are not tackling these problems. In short a somewhat more radical, and unpopular, policy is required.
British rail is notorously slow, late and expensive and the hype of rail travel and steam trains is long since gone with many old tracks being dismantled. If we are to alleviate the roads in Britain them we must encourage rail travel in Britain and we should be opening new lines not closing old ones. Perhaps the privatisation of British Rail will produce a more competitive service but I fear that it will will result in the closure of smaller less profitable lines and only a better service on the main routes. Why is British rail so unreliable? Most of the world besides Britain seems to run a reliable service even developing countries. Few efforts have been made to make the fares cheaper and a more desirable form of family travel, with the Family railcard really being a nonstarter.
Until the rail service improves people will continue to use the ever increasingly clogged up roads. Simply widening and building new roads is not a solution as the number of cars on the roads simply increases to "fill in the gaps". With the Newbury bypass work now being stopped for 3 days running I can sympathise with the protestors. We are simply running out of room to build new roads.
One of the main side effects of road travel in particular is pollution. Acid rain, asthma and many other problems are rife and soon the fuels for these cars will be running out. Gas buses and gars is really only a short term solution and a renewable source must be found. But with petrol companies unwilling to investigate water and alcohol powered cars for fear of losing petrol sales these still seem a long way off as our everyday form of transport.
Solutions for these problems in Britain have been fairly unimaginative and unsuccessful. Park and ride schemes are common to discourage people from taking their cars into city centres as are pedestrian streets and one way systems but they have done little to relieve the problem. The average speed of traffic in Central London is no faster than that of 200 years ago when horse drawn carriages were being used. What is needed is a large increase in road tax and tax on fuels to make car travel more expensive. Encourage the use of bikes with schemes like the "Green Bike Scheme" proposed in Exeter where bikes can be picked up and used and dropped off at various points around the city for free. Introduce heavy tolls on the roads to combat foreign traffic in Britain as well as local. Encourage car pools to reduce the number of cars driving around with one person in them. Firmly impose Green Belts around cities to reduce urban sprawl. Introduce a heavy tax system for commuters who make up a large bulk of city traffic.
The problem with these schemes is that they are unpopular and beneficial to nobody in the short term. For these reasons any political party proposing these would be unlikely to be voted for but Britain must face up to its transport problems and do something about them.
